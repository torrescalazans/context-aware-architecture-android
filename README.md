# Android - Context-aware architecture

An architecture for providing environmental context data for context-aware 
mobile applications.

Context-aware applications may be developed for several kinds of 
computational platforms, ranging from more traditional computers to mobile devices.

However, its relevance becomes more noticeable on dynamic environments which 
have more frequent data changes, such as, applications executed on smartphones.

Developing mechanisms for obtaining, storing, managing, distributing and sharing 
context data present on the environment is a task that demands additional effort, as it 
adds extra logics and control structures (which are not part of the application 
domain), therefore increasing the development complexity, its schedule and its 
maintenance cost.

This research presents one architecture for providing context data 
specifically developed taking into account the several limitations inherent to 
smartphones, such as, low processing capacity, limited memory, unstable network 
connectivity, low duration batteries, amongst others. Throughout this work, a 
prototype for a context-aware application was developed in order to illustrate the use 
of this type of context provider, its mechanism, components, functionalities and 
services, which were designed with the objective of helping the development of such 
kind of applications.
